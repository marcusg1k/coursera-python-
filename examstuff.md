Best practices for writing code that is readable and reusable: 
Create a reusable function: replace duplicate code with one reusable function ot make the code easier to read and repurpose
Refactor code: Update code so that it is self-documenting and the intent of the code is clear.

Review: Comparing things

Introduction
This follow-along reading is organized to match the content in the video that follows. It contains the same code shown in the next video. These code blocks will provide you with the opportunity to see how the code is written, allow you to practice running it, and can be used as a reference to refer back to. 

Logical operators: AND, OR, NOT
To evaluate as true, the operator AND would need both expressions to be true at the same time
To evalute as true, the operator OR would need only 1 of the conditions to be true to return as true
The NOT operator inverts the value of the expression thats in front of it
if expression is true it becomes false, if it is false it becomes true

"==" (equality)
"!=" (not equal to) 
">" (greater than)
"<" (less than)
">=" (greater than or equal to)
"<=" (less than or equal to)
