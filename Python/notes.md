 python beginner notes

  First created by Guido Van Rossum in 1991. 
  -> py resources:   https://docs.python.org/3/ , python uses interpreter not a compiler. 
  Whenever there is a change to the syntax or semantics of the language, new major updates tend to release. 
  There are platform specific scripting languages, Powershell is used on windows and BASH is used on linux. 
  Functions = Pieces of code that perform a unit of work. (if, while, for)
  Keywords - Reserved words that are used to construct instructions. 
  using double quotations lets the intepreter know the text preceding is considered a string for example: "Hello, World" <- considered a string. Any text that isnt in quotations is considered part of the code. 
  General scripting languages like perl or ruby. 

  Math operands explained:
 x + y            Addition + operator returns the sum of x plus y
 x - y             Subtraction - operator returns the difference of x minus y
 x * y            Multiplication * operator returns the product of x times y
 x / y             Division / operator returns the quotient of x divided by y
 x**e            Exponent ** operator returns the result of raising x to the power of e 
 x**2            Square expression returns x squared
 x**3            Cube expression returns x cubed
 x**(1/2)    Square root (½) or (0.5) fractional exponent operator returns the square root of x
 x // y           Floor division operator returns the integer part of the integer division of x by y
 x % y          Modulo operator returns the remainder part of the integer division of x by y

   Key Terms
   Platform-specific / OS specific scripting language - Platform-specific scripting languages, like PowerShell (for Windows) and Bash (for Linux), are used by system administrators on those platforms. 
   Client-side scripting language - Client-side scripting languages, like JavaScript, are used mostly for web programming. The scripts are transferred from a web server to the end-user’s internet browser, then executed in the browser.
   Machine language - Machine language is the lowest-level computer language. It communicates directly with computing machines in binary code (ones and zeros). In binary code, one equals a pulse of electricity and zero equals no electrical pulse. Machine language instructions are made from translating languages like Python into complex patterns of ones and zeros. 
   Cross-platform language - Programming language that is compatible with one or more platforms / operating systems (e.g., Windows, Linux, Mac, iOS, Android).
   Object-oriented programming language - In object-oriented programming languages, most coding elements are considered to be objects with configurable properties. For example, a form field is an object that can be configured to accept only dates as input in the mm/dd/yy format, and can be configured to read from and write to a specific database. 
   Python interpreter - An interpreter is the program that reads and executes Python code by translating Python code into computer instructions.
  Python can also be used as a calculator for example (1+2) = 3. To get 2 to the power of 10 it is inputted by using (2**10) = 1024. 
  Values: True, False, None
  Conditions: if, elif, else
  Logical operators: and, or, not
  Loops: for, in, while, break, continue
  Functions: def, return  

  Glossary terms ~ course 1 module 1
  Automation: The process of replacing a manual step with one that happens automatically
  Client-side scripting language: Primarily for web programming; the scripts are transferred from a web server to the end-user’s internet browser, then executed in the browser
  Code editors: Tools to provide features, including syntax highlighting, automatic indentation, error checking, and autocompletion
  Computer program: A step-by-step list of instructions that a computer follows to reach an intended goal
  Functions: A reusable block of code that performs a specific task
  IDE: A software application that provides comprehensive facilities for software development
  Interpreter: The program that reads and executes code
  Input: Information that is provided to a program by the end user
  Logic errors: Errors in code that prevent it from running correctly
  Machine language: Lowest-level computer language. It communicates directly with computing machines in binary code (ones and zeros)
  Object-oriented programming language: Most coding elements are considered to be objects with configurable properties
  Output: the end result of a task performed by a function or computer program
  Platform-specific scripting language: Language used by system administrators on those specific platforms
  Programming: The process of writing a program to behave in different ways
  Programming code: A set of written computer instructions, guided by rules, using a computer programming language
  Programming languages: Language with syntax and semantics to write computer programs
  Python: A general purpose programming language
  Python interpreter: Program that reads and executes Python code by translating Python code into computer instructions
  Script: Often used to automate specific tasks
  Semantics: The intended meaning or effect of statements, or collections of words, in both human and computer languages
  Syntax: The rules for how each statement is constructed in both human and computer languages
  Variables: These are used to temporarily store changeable values in programming code

  Implicit Conversion: The interpreter automatically converts one data type into another
  Explicit Conversion: We manually convert the data type of one to incorporate use into another data type 
  str() - converts a value (often numeric) to a string data type
  int() - converts a value (usually a float) to an integer data type 
  float() - converts a value (usually an integer) to a float data type

  Dictionary: Stores key:value pairs, immutable keys but mutable and duplicate values (no, it is unordered and random)
  Set: An unordered collection of unique elements, mutable but unique elements only (no, it is unordered and unique)
  List: A sequential, mutable collection of any data type, mutable and allows duplicate elements (yes, and with numeric index assignment) 
  String: A sequential, immutable collection of textual data, immutable but allows duplicate elements (yes, but with a sequence of textual data) 
  Tuple: A sequential, immutable collection of any data type, immutable but allows duplicate elements (yes, and with numeric index assignment)
