#when dealing with code duplication its important to focus on how to cut down on it

# Use a function to return the result of a measurement conversion
# Use aritmetic operators to perform a calculation
# Combine text with  a funciton call within a print() statement
# Convert the return value from a float data type to a string for the print() function
# Call the function and perform a calculation ont the return value within a print() statement

# This function converts fluid ounces to milliliters and returns the 
# result of the conversion.
def convert_volume(fluid_ounce):
# Calculate value of the "ml" variable using the parameter variable 
# "fluid_ounce". There are approximately 29.5 milliliters in 1 fluid
# ounce.
    ml = fluid_ounce * 29.5  
# Return the result of the calculation.  
    return ml
 
# Call the conversion from within the print() function using 2 fluid 
# ounces. Convert the return value from a float to a string.  
print("The volume in milliliters is " + str(convert_volume(2)))
 
# Call the function again and double the 2 fluid ounces from within
# the print function.
print("The volume in milliliters is " + str(convert_volume(2)*2))
# Alternative calculation:
# print("The volume in milliliters is " + str(convert_volume(4))
